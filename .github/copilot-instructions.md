## Page structure

When creating new pages, follow the established structure used in the project. Typically, a page component should be placed in the `app` directory (depending on the Next.js version) and should include:

The web app (at `apps/web/src/app`) has the following structure:
- Dashboard pages under `dashboard/`
- Component pages under `components/`
- Internationalization files under `i18n`

## Component usage

Try always to use already existing components from the codebase when applicable instead of creating new ones. This ensures consistency across the application and reduces redundancy. For example, use existing UI components for select, buttons, forms, and layouts
